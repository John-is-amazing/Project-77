        <p>
            Visual Studio Code is like codepen.io except you don't need Wi-Fi to use it.
            This makes it more accecable to more people. If you want to use it then you need to make a folder.
            Not a file. If you look near the top, you can see 3 lines. What you want to do is to click it.
            After that, there's a button called, 'file.' You would want to press it and then click on, 'Folder.'
            Once you've done that, you can choose your folder and start coding.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now that you're familiar with VSC (Visual Studio Code), You discover something called, 'Console.'
            You can type anything in the console but you need to make a variable and call it.
            If you want to do that, then you use, 'console.log().' In the brackets you call the variable
            and you should see it in the console. If not try ask for help.
